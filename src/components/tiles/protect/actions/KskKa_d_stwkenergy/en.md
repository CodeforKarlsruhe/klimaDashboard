## Renewable Offerings by Stadtwerke Karlsruhe

We all consume electricity in our households. Many household appliances that are in use are also replaced over time with energy-saving devices. However, we can also actively save electricity by considering how we operate devices in an energy-efficient manner, such as turning off lights and unplugging devices from standby mode. By using green electricity or electricity from a PV system, greenhouse gas emissions can be reduced. The per capita electricity consumption and the share of green electricity are important for the climate impact.
