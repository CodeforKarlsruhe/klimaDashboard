## Greenhouse Gas

With an annual energy and greenhouse gas balance, a municipality can monitor whether the targeted climate goals are being met. The climate goal of "climate neutrality" by a specific target year has now become established. There are also often intermediate goals.

The city of Karlsruhe aims to achieve climate neutrality by 2040. There is also an intermediate goal for 2030, by which 58% of greenhouse gases should be reduced. The reference year here is 2010, meaning the city of Karlsruhe wants to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 58% in 20 years. The greenhouse gas balance is calculated from the energy consumption of individual energy sources per year. The energy consumption is then converted according to the energy source using a specific emission factor.
