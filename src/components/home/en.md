## Climate Dashboard Karlsruhe

Where does Karlsruhe stand on the path to climate neutrality? 

And where are the impacts of climate change already visible in Karlsruhe? 

The Climate Dashboard shows the current data status for various indicators of climate protection and adaptation to the impacts of climate change, thus creating more transparency in the city's overall climate efforts. The Climate Dashboard was developed by the Smart City Task Force and the Climate Task Force of the City of Karlsruhe with support from Stadtwerke Karlsruhe and the Karlsruhe Economic Development Agency. We are continuously working to improve the availability of data. The Climate Dashboard is funded under the "Smart Cities Model Projects" funding program by the Federal Ministry for Housing, Urban Development and Building (BMWSB).
