1) Greenhouse Gas (total by energy sources per sector), per person

With an annual energy and greenhouse gas balance, a municipality can monitor whether the targeted climate goals are being met. The climate goal of "climate neutrality" by a specific target year has now become established. There are also often intermediate goals.

The city of Karlsruhe aims to achieve climate neutrality by 2040. There is also an intermediate goal for 2030, by which 58% of greenhouse gases should be reduced. The reference year here is 2010, meaning the city of Karlsruhe wants to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 58% in 20 years. The greenhouse gas balance is calculated from the energy consumption of individual energy sources per year. The energy consumption is then converted according to the energy source using a specific emission factor.


2) Energy

Electricity consumption per capita in households, share of green electricity (I have the latest environmental statement from the municipal utilities, which should contain green electricity figures for 2023)

We all consume electricity in our households. Many household appliances in use are also replaced with energy-saving devices over time. But we can also actively save electricity by considering how to operate devices in an energy-saving way, such as turning off lights and disconnecting devices from standby mode. By using green electricity or electricity from a PV system, greenhouse gas emissions can be reduced. The per capita electricity consumption and the share of green electricity are important for climate impact.

Heating mix in households - district heating, gas, oil, biomass - there are also new Census 2022 data available here

How we heat our houses affects the climate balance. Natural gas and heating oil are fossil fuels with a poor climate impact. District heating from industrial waste heat is already better, and the best way is to heat our well-insulated houses with environmental heat made available through a heat pump.

Renewable energies such as biomass or solar heat also have a positive effect on the climate.

In a municipality, the local energy provider, in Karlsruhe the municipal utilities, can ensure that many houses have a climate-friendly heat supply. In Karlsruhe, this is happening through the expansion of the district heating network while simultaneously using more and more climate-friendly heat for the district heating network, such as waste heat that would otherwise not be used or the use of geothermal energy.

Renewable PV expansion, balcony modules

Renewable energies such as solar power, wind and hydropower make our electricity more climate-friendly. Therefore, it is important to replace the consumption of fossil fuels with more and more renewables. For solar power, everyone can also become active themselves and install a balcony module on their house to use climate-friendly electricity for their own household appliances. In a city like Karlsruhe, there is a lot of space on roofs for solar modules. The city can lead by example and install solar modules on administrative buildings, schools, kindergartens and on the town hall.

3) Mobility (car, bicycle, public transport) the modal split is unfortunately only surveyed every few years,
Car mileage compared to mileage from city cycling 2023 - action period 4 weeks/bicycle counters?

The fuels in our car engines have a negative climate impact. In our own everyday mobility, it's about reaching a certain place. But I can do this in many ways. Using the car is only one possibility. I can often get to a certain place by bicycle, bus or tram, which are all climate-friendly means of transport. There are also climate-friendly alternatives for private cars, such as electric vehicles and car-sharing vehicles. It's about covering daily routes as climate-friendly as possible. If I use the "RegioMove" app in Karlsruhe, I get the greenhouse gases caused for each trip and each mode of transport displayed and can decide on a climate-friendly trip.

4) Finance/Consulting - Consulting services of the KEK, funding KSK - I would also have to think about the presentation of figures.

To behave in a climate-friendly way, I need some information, as climate-friendliness is still not part of everyday routine. When it comes to my own house and the use of electricity from renewable energies, I can get advice on many topics from the Karlsruhe Energy and Climate Protection Agency - KEK. Since climate-friendly behavior is often subsidized, I also get the relevant information from KEK about who I can ask for funding. The city of Karlsruhe also has its own funding program called KlimaBonus, where I can get grants for renovating my house or setting up a solar system.
